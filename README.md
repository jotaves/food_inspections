# Food Inspections

Restaurants (or any other establishment that deals with food) and most specifically a restaurant's kitchen, can contain many unsanitary things and staff can be to blame for many unhygienic habits. On this account, it is required that these establishment have food inspections monthly/yearly, and this comes as a benefit for the customers who are  going to frequent these restaurants.

In this notebook, we will analyze the results of food inspections in Chicago from January 1, 2010 to the present and associate the risks according to each type of facility and the quantity of violations each one has, as well as determine the amount of inspections in a specific period of time.

Inspections are performed by staff from the Chicago Department of Public Health’s Food Protection Program. They are done using a standardized procedure. The results of the inspection are inputted into a database, then reviewed and approved by a State of Illinois Licensed Environmental Health Practitioner (LEHP). A subset of data elements are extracted from this database and downloaded into this data portal.
