They are done using a standardized procedure. The results of the inspection are inputted into a database, then reviewed and approved by a State of Illinois Licensed Environmental Health Practitioner (LEHP). A subset of data elements are extracted from this database and downloaded into this data portal. These elements are: \n","\n","> * **DBA**: ‘Doing business as.’ This is the legal name of the establishment.\n","* **AKA**: ‘Also known as.’ This is the name the public would know the establishment as.\n","* **License number**: This is a unique number assigned to the establishment for the\n","purposes of licensing by the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection.\n","* **Type of facility**: Each establishment is described by one of the following: bakery, banquet\n","hall, candy store, caterer, coffee shop, day care center (for ages less than 2), day care\n","center (for ages 2 – 6), day care center (combo, for ages less than 2 and 2 – 6\n","combined), gas station, Golden Diner, grocery store, hospital, long term care\n","center(nursing home), liquor store, mobile food dispenser, restaurant, paleteria, school,\n","shelter, tavern, social club, wholesaler, or Wrigley Field Rooftop.\n","* **Risk category**: Each establishment is categorized as to its risk of adversely\n","affecting the public’s health, with 1 being the highest and 3 the lowest. The frequency of\n","inspection is tied to this risk, with risk 1 establishments inspected most frequently and\n","risk 3 least frequently.\n","* **Street address, city, state and zip code of facility**: This is the complete address where\n","the facility is located.\n","* **Inspection date**: This is the date the inspection occurred. A particular establishment is\n","likely to have multiple inspections which are denoted by different inspection dates.\n","* **Inspection type**: An inspection can be one of the following types: canvass, the most\n","common type of inspection performed at a frequency relative to the risk of the\n","establishment; consultation, when the inspection is done at the request of the owner\n","prior to the opening of the establishment; complaint, when the inspection is done in\n","response to a complaint against the establishment; license, when the inspection is done\n","as a requirement for the establishment to receive its license to operate; suspect food\n","poisoning, when the inspection is done in response to one or more persons claiming to\n","have gotten ill as a result of eating at the establishment (a specific type of complaint-\n","based inspection); task-force inspection, when an inspection of a bar or tavern is done.\n","Re-inspections can occur for most types of these inspections and are indicated as such.\n","* **Results**: An inspection can pass, pass with conditions or fail. Establishments receiving a\n","‘pass’ were found to have no critical or serious violations (violation number 1-14 and 15-\n","29, respectively). Establishments receiving a ‘pass with conditions’ were found to have\n","critical or serious violations, but these were corrected during the inspection.\n","Establishments receiving a ‘fail’ were found to have critical or serious violations that\n","were not correctable during the inspection. An establishment receiving a ‘fail’ does not\n","necessarily mean the establishment’s licensed is suspended. Establishments found to\n","be out of business or not located are indicated as such.\n","* **Violations**: An establishment can receive one or more of 45 distinct violations (violation\n","numbers 1-44 and 70).
